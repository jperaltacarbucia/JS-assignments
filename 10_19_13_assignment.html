The score is 76. If the score is more than or equal to 90, your grade is A. 
If the score is more than or equal to 80, your grade is B. If the score is 
more than or equal to 70, your grade is C. If the score is more than or equal 
to 60, your grade is D, else your grade is F. The score is 76, therefore is 
going to print that the grade is a C.
